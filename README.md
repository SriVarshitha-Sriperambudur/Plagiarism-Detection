# Plagiarism-Detection using Natural Language Processing

A powerful and extensible Plagiarism Detection Tool that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to analyze and compare the textual similarity of documents (.txt, .docx, .pdf).

ðŸ“Œ Features:

âœ… Supports .txt, .docx, and .pdf files

âœ… Reads and preprocesses documents (case normalization, whitespace removal)

âœ… Uses TF-IDF to extract top terms from each document

âœ… Computes cosine similarity between each pair of files

âœ… Generates a detailed plagiarism report with timestamp

âœ… Handles missing files, unsupported formats, and errors gracefully

âœ… Command-line interface (CLI) for batch comparison


ðŸ§  NLP Techniques Used:

TF-IDF Vectorization: Transforms documents into numerical features while reducing the effect of common words.

Cosine Similarity: Measures the angle between vector representations to calculate document similarity.

Text Preprocessing: Lowercasing, whitespace cleanup, and token normalization.
